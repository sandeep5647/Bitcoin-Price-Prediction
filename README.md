# Bitcoin Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a Bitcoin Price Prediction Model using historical price data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model predicts future Bitcoin prices based on past trends and is built using Python with Streamlit for the web interface.

## Features
- Displays historical Bitcoin price data.
- Predicts future Bitcoin prices using an LSTM model.
- Interactive charts showing predicted vs. original prices.
- Dark theme for a better user experience.

## Model Training
The LSTM model is trained on historical Bitcoin price data fetched from the Yahoo Finance API. The model's architecture includes:
- Input layer
- LSTM layers 
- Output layer

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Lab
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pandas
- yFinance
- Plotly

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms for price prediction.
- Allow users to input different cryptocurrencies for prediction.
- Improve the UI/UX design for better interactivity.
